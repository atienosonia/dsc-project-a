# Phase 1 Project 

## Project Overview

The above project uses exploratory data analysis to generate insights and ultimately give reccommendations on whether Microsoft should join in on the film industry and whether it was a good decision for them to create a film studio.


### Business Understanding

Microsoft is looking to join in the film industry and they want to know what type of films they can create. This project aims to look if Microsoft joining the industry was the right call. The long term reveue generated from being in the industry .It is also going to look at previuos trends that are useful in future revenue predictions. We are also going to look at how different film production studios have been performing.

### The Data

We only used one dataset to generate insights. You can find the dataset following the link :

* [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)

### Description of Data
- The dataset used was a comma separated file. The dataset contained 3387 entries and 5 features.
- It had two numerical data and three categorical data
- I majorly used three columns for my analysis, the studio ,domestic gross and the year column.
- I used log to rescale and treat my outliers which is crucial when part of the dataset is important
- There is a strong positive correlation betweeen the domestic and foreign gross variables , an increase in revenue in the domestic market means an adjacent increase in the revenue market 
- Based on the trend of the foreign and domestic gross line graph we notice the flunctuating revenue income and the market resiliency 
 
- I assumed that the domestic and foreign gross income represent revenue sales even after rescaling the columns.
- The outliers present in the foreign gross column were assumed to be genuine

### Conclusion

Microsoft should instead partner up with the top performing studios rather than creating their own.

I would make the following reccomendations:

- The gross income revenue is dependent on the Studio producing the film and therefore instead of microsoft  creating a new movie studio they should in turn partner with studioâ€™s that have been generating consistent high revenue in the market and collaborate with them.

- The percentage gross income of foreign market is much higher than domestic market and so I would advise microsoft to invest in foreign markets due to high profitability index

- Based on the trends from the previous years , microsoft should only enter the film industry market if they only are risk takers due to the fluctuating revenue income.# Phase 1 Project
